## Technologies Used :

# React JS:

React basically gives developers the ability to work with a virtual browser that is more friendly than the real browser. React's virtual browser acts like an agent between the developer and the real browser. JSX comes in handy when we can write HTML in javascirpt which makes things easier & smooth.

# HTML & CSS

# Material-UI:

Material UI is a stable set of react components that not only look good, but also are easy to use and customize & include your own css.

# Axios:

for making it easier to comsume API's as compared to fetch.

## Improvemets if allocated more time:

- Would have included a serach bar for making it easier to select candidate form candidate list.
- Would have worked more on designing , css to make it look more nicer.
- Would have included Redux.
- Would have used only material-ui in designing using css and not have included css in App.css.
- Added more validations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
